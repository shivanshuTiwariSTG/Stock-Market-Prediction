# Stock-Market-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-mapped-with-Sentiments-Analysis


Stock market is one of efficient method to generate a good amount of capital. If somebody is able to predict any stock’s price then he/she can be a millionaire or billionaire overnight. </br>
Predicting how the stock market will perform is one of the most difficult things to do. There are so many factors involved in the prediction – physical factors vs. physiological, rational and irrational behavior, etc. All these aspects combine to make share prices volatile and very difficult to predict with a high degree of accuracy. In this project, we took the public sentiments factor in account and generate an accurate predictor for the trend of stock market. 

## Objective
The aim of this project is as follows:</br></br>
i)	To predict the stock market prices and visualize them in the most precise and accurate manner.</br>
ii)	To provide investors an estimate cost of stock market price so that they can invest in share market.</br>
iii)	Through the predicted and analyzed data, companies and industry can use it to breakdown their limitations and enhance their stock value.

## Methodology
In this project, we have worked with historical data about the stock prices of a publicly listed company. We have implemented a mix of machine learning algorithms to predict the future stock price of this company, starting with simple algorithms like multiple linear regression, and then move on to advanced techniques like Auto ARIMA(Time Series Forecasting) and LSTM. Furthermore, in order to make the algorithm more accurate we have mapped the algorithms with the Public Sentiments.
The Algorithms used to predict the future stock of a company is: </br></br>
• Multiple Linear Regression </br>
• Auto ARIMA </br>
• LSTM(Long short-term memory)
